 * Electricity consumption data is returned to the nearest 0.001kwh.
 * For billing, consumption is rounded to the nearest 0.01kwh before multiplying by the price.
 * The rounding method used is rounding half to even, where numbers ending in 5 are rounded up or down, towards the nearest even hundredth decimal place.
 * As a result, 0.015 would be rounded up to 0.02, while 0.025 is rounded down to 0.02.
